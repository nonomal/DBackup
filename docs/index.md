## Quick Start

Get DBackup running in minutes with Docker:

::: code-group

```bash [Docker Run]
docker run -d --name dbackup -p 3000:3000 \
  -e ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  -e BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
  -e BETTER_AUTH_URL="https://localhost:3000" \
  -v "$(pwd)/data:/data" \
  -v "$(pwd)/backups:/backups" \
  skyfay/dbackup:latest
```

```yaml [Docker Compose]
services:
  dbackup:
    image: skyfay/dbackup:latest
    container_name: dbackup
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - ENCRYPTION_KEY=  # openssl rand -hex 32
      - BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://localhost:3000
      - BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=  # openssl rand -base64 32
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data              # All persistent data (db, storage, certs)
      - ./backups:/backups        # Optional: used for local backups
```

:::


Then open [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) and create your first admin account (accept the self-signed certificate on first visit).

## Your Backups, Your Control

DBackup is designed as a convenience layer, not a dependency. Every backup it creates is a **standard database dump** (SQL, BSON, RDB, etc.), the same format you'd get from running `pg_dump`, `mysqldump`, or `mongodump` yourself.

Even encrypted backups use **open AES-256-GCM** with a simple sidecar `.meta.json` file for the IV and auth tag. If DBackup is ever unavailable, you can still:

1. **Decrypt** any backup with the included standalone Node.js script (zero external dependencies)
2. **Decompress** automatically (GZIP or Brotli is handled by the same script)
3. **Import** the resulting dump directly with your database's native CLI tool

The **[Recovery Kit](/user-guide/security/recovery-kit)** (downloadable from Vault) bundles everything you need: your encryption key, the decryption script, and platform-specific helper scripts for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

::: tip
Download your Recovery Kit after creating an Encryption Profile and store it offline (USB drive, password manager, printed). It's your safety net if DBackup or the server it runs on is no longer accessible.

## Architecture at a Glance

DBackup is built with modern technologies:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 (App Router), React, Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: Next.js Server Actions, Prisma ORM
- **Database**: SQLite for application state
- **Streaming**: Native Node.js streams for efficient encryption/compression

The plugin-based adapter architecture makes it easy to add new databases, storage providers, or notification channels.

## 🤖 AI Development Transparency

### Architecture & Concept

The system architecture, infrastructure design, strict technology stack selection, and feature specifications for DBackup were entirely conceptualized and directed by a human System Engineer to solve real-world infrastructure challenges.

### Implementation

The application code was generated by AI coding agents following detailed architectural specifications and coding guidelines. All features were manually tested for correctness, stability, and real-world reliability. Automated unit tests (Vitest) and static security audits complement the manual QA process.

### Open for Review

DBackup is thoroughly tested and used in production, but a formal manual security audit by an external developer has not yet been completed. If you are a software developer or cybersecurity professional, your expertise is highly welcome! We invite the open-source community to review the code, submit PRs, and help us elevate DBackup to a fully verified, enterprise-ready standard.

> **Security Disclosure**: If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public GitHub issue. Instead, report it responsibly via email to **[security@dbackup.app](mailto:security@dbackup.app)**.

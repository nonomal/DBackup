### What is DBackup?

DBackup is a comprehensive, self-hosted backup solution designed to automate and secure your database backups. It provides AES-256-GCM encryption, flexible storage options, and intelligent retention policies to ensure your data is always protected and recoverable.

Whether you're running a single MySQL database or managing multiple PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQL Server instances, DBackup offers a unified interface with real-time monitoring, granular access control, and seamless restore capabilities.

**No vendor lock-in by design** - every backup is a standard database dump (SQL, BSON, RDB, etc.) encrypted with open AES-256-GCM. If DBackup is ever unavailable, you can decrypt and restore your backups with a single Node.js script and the key from your Recovery Kit. No proprietary formats, no dependencies on DBackup itself.

## ✨ Features

### 🗄️ Database Backup

- **7 Database Engines** - MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, Redis, and Microsoft SQL Server
- **Selective Database Backup** - Choose exactly which databases to back up per job instead of creating separate sources for each database
- **Multi-Database Jobs** - Back up multiple databases from a single source in one job with a unified TAR archive format
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption** - Encrypt backups with managed Encryption Profiles, key rotation, and downloadable Recovery Kits for offline decryption
- **GZIP & Brotli Compression** - Reduce backup size and storage costs with built-in compression

### ☁️ Storage & Destinations

- **13+ Storage Adapters** - S3, Cloudflare R2, Hetzner, Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, SFTP, FTP, WebDAV, SMB, Rsync, and local filesystem
- **Multi-Destination Jobs** - Upload each backup to multiple storage destinations simultaneously for redundancy or off-site copies
- **Storage Explorer** - Browse backup files across all destinations, inspect metadata, download files, or generate secure direct download links
- **Storage Monitoring & Alerts** - Per-destination alerts for usage spikes, storage limit warnings, and missing backups within a defined time window

### 🔄 Restore & Recovery

- **One-Click Restore** - Restore directly from the Storage Explorer to any configured database target
- **Database Remapping** - Restore databases under different names or map multiple databases to new targets
- **Version Compatibility Check** - Pre-restore validation warns about version mismatches before execution
- **SHA-256 Integrity Verification** - Checksums generated on backup and verified before restore
- **No Vendor Lock-In** - Backups are standard database dumps encrypted with open AES-256-GCM. Decrypt and import manually with just Node.js, no DBackup required
- **Recovery Kit** - Downloadable ZIP with your encryption key and a standalone decryption script for disaster recovery without DBackup

### 📊 Monitoring & Visibility

- **Live Backup Progress** - Real-time progress tracking shows exactly what's happening during backup and restore operations
- **Interactive Dashboard** - Activity charts, job status overview, KPI cards, and auto-refreshing activity feeds
- **Database Explorer** - Browse databases, tables, and live data directly from DBackup with server-side pagination, full-text search, schema inspection, and deep-link URL support across all 7 database engines
- **Storage Usage History** - Track storage growth over time with area charts and trend indicators
- **Execution History** - Full log of every backup and restore with duration, file size, status, and error details

### 🔔 Notifications

- **9 Notification Channels** - Discord, Slack, Teams, Telegram, Gotify, ntfy, Webhook, SMS (Twilio), and Email (SMTP)
- **Per-Job Notification Settings** - Configure which notification channels fire for each backup job individually
- **System Event Notifications** - Get notified about user logins, account creation, restore results, storage alerts, update availability, and system errors across all channels
- **Repeat Intervals** - Configurable reminder intervals for recurring alerts (storage warnings, update notices)

### ⏰ Scheduling & Retention

- **Cron-based Scheduling** - Flexible job scheduling with a visual Schedule Picker (Simple Mode + Cron Mode)
- **GFS Retention Policies** - Grandfather-Father-Son rotation with per-destination retention settings
- **Automated Config Backups** - Self-backup of the entire DBackup configuration to any storage adapter

### 👥 Access Control & Security

- **Fine-grained API Keys** - Scoped permissions and expiration dates for CI/CD pipelines and scripts
- **Ready-made Examples** - cURL, Bash, and Ansible examples included in the API docs

### 🎨 Designed for Simplicity

- **Intuitive UI** - Clean, modern interface that makes complex backup workflows feel simple
- **Quick Setup Wizard** - Guided 7-step first-run setup to get your first backup running in minutes
- **Highly Configurable** - Session lifetimes, rate limits, retention periods, notification preferences, system tasks, and more
- **Docker Ready** - Multi-arch images (AMD64/ARM64), health checks, graceful shutdown, and configurable PUID/PGID

## 🤖 AI Development Transparency

### Architecture & Concept

The system architecture, infrastructure design, strict technology stack selection, and feature specifications for DBackup were entirely conceptualized and directed by a human System Engineer to solve real-world infrastructure challenges.

### Implementation

The application code was generated by AI coding agents following detailed architectural specifications and coding guidelines. All features were manually tested for correctness, stability, and real-world reliability. Automated unit tests (Vitest) and static security audits complement the manual QA process.

### Open for Review

DBackup is thoroughly tested and used in production, but a formal manual security audit by an external developer has not yet been completed. If you are a software developer or cybersecurity professional, your expertise is highly welcome! We invite the open-source community to review the code, submit PRs, and help us elevate DBackup to a fully verified, enterprise-ready standard.

> **Security Disclosure**: If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public GitHub issue. Instead, report it responsibly via email to **[security@dbackup.app](mailto:security@dbackup.app)**.
